# Applied-Data-Science-Project-2

This Shiny app enables users to upload and load datasets in multiple formats (.csv, .xlsx, .json, .rds) dynamically. It also offers the option to load built-in sample datasets (mtcars or iris) and displays the selected dataset in a reactive data table (DT) for easy exploration.

Once a dataset is uploaded, users can perform the following preprocessing functionalities:
- Standardizing Column Names: Converts column names to lowercase and replaces spaces with underscores to maintain consistency.
- Removing Duplicates: Detects and removes duplicate rows to avoid redundancy.
- Handling Missing Values (Mean & Median): Users can opt for either mean or median imputation, replacing missing numeric values with their respective statistical measures.
- Text Cleaning: Options include trimming whitespace, converting text to lowercase, and removing special characters to ensure uniform formatting.
- Date Standardization: Converts date columns into a consistent YYYY-MM-DD format and allows for the extraction of features such as year, month, and day.
- Outlier Handling (Z-Score & Mean): Users can either remove outliers using a Z-score threshold (greater than 3) or replace them with the mean value.
- Fixing Inconsistent Categorical Labels: Standardizes text-based categorical values to ensure consistency.
- Dropping High-Missing Columns: Removes columns where a significant portion of values are missing, ensuring a cleaner dataset.

Further data preprocessing steps available to the user include scaling numerical data (either standardizing with z-scores or normalizing using min-max scaling), encoding categorical features through one-hot encoding, and handling outliers. Outlier handling options include capping extreme values at set Z-score thresholds, replacing outliers with the mean, or removing them based on the interquartile range (IQR) method.

Polynomial: Users can raise a selected numeric column to a specified power (e.g., squaring, cubing) to capture non-linear relationships. 

Interaction: Users can multiplies two numeric columns, creating a new column that may reveal interaction effects between variables.

Datetime: Users can select a date or date-like column, and if necessary, the app will attempt to parse it into a valid Date format (YYYY-MM-DD). Once successfully parsed, columns for year, month, and day are automatically generated.

Save:  Users can download the fully processed dataset as a CSV file.

EDA: In the eda part, users can view data previews, data information, categorical variable analysis, and numerical variable analysis in the display area below. And also can draw multiple graphsï¼Œvisually display data characteristics and multivariate relationships.Specific chart types include scatter plots, histograms, box plots, time series plots and so on.
